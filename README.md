### Twitter Reply Bot (explorer) runs 24/7
Twitter Reply Bot with a database (remembers users, don't contact twice the same one, don't repeat) which discovers customers (they don't have to make any prior contact) and people searching for a help. This is the free version. 
Very affordably, cheap, I am the author (programmer) and of course, the first one who can set up it for you, on demand and customized.

### What is the deal?
To run 24/7 and spend another time in a research, you need 4-6 people (they don't work 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, you need 3 human workers per day and others to cover holidays, and sick leave). If you live in an expensiver country like the UK, it would costs you Â£80.000+ per year. Can you get the work power of 6 people for free? For a small set up fee... (to compare with other programmers, I'm amazingly cheap and one can think that I know what I do because I wrote each one line of the code, code which obviously works). Feel free to contact me and any consultation (talks) will be for free, only programming work is charged (a fixed amount per project).
