### Twitter Reply Bot (explorer) runs 24/7
Twitter Reply Bot with a database (remembers users, doesn't contact twice the same one, doesn't repeat), recognize/match synonyms with regex, synonymic randomizer (it doesn't repeat vocabulary), etc... which discovers customers (they don't have to make any prior contact) and people searching for help (who wanna hire you). This is the free version (so it's uncustomized for a paticular business needs (profile of activities) for a specific case that requires the customization, additional work).

### What is the deal?
To run 24/7 and spend another time in research, you need 4-6 people (they don't work 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, you need 3 human workers per day and others to cover holidays and sick leave). If you live in an expensive country like the UK, it would costs you Â£80.000+ per year. Can you get the work power of 6 people for free? If you don't think that you can do it just by yourself and need will need a help, I'm amazingly cheap (you already see that none rich gives an open source, that's not the way) and you already see that my code obviously works. Feel free to contact me and any consultation (talks) will be for free, then the programming work is charged with a fixed price (an agreement without surprises) per any project/results, not hourly.
